.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
createrepo_c [options] <directory>
.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-V \-\-version
.sp
Show program\(aqs version number and exit.
.SS \-q \-\-quiet
.sp
Run quietly.
.SS \-v \-\-verbose
.sp
Run verbosely.
.SS \-x \-\-excludes PACKAGE_NAME_GLOB
.sp
File globs to exclude, can be specified multiple times.
.SS \-\-basedir BASEDIR
.sp
Basedir for path to directories.
.SS \-u \-\-baseurl URL
.sp
Optional base URL location for all files.
.SS \-g \-\-groupfile GROUPFILE
.sp
Path to groupfile to include in metadata.
.SS \-s \-\-checksum CHECKSUM_TYPE
.sp
Choose the checksum type used in repomd.xml and for packages in the metadata. The default is now sha256.
.SS \-p \-\-pretty
.sp
Make sure all xml generated is formatted (default)
.SS \-d \-\-database
.sp
Generate sqlite databases for use with yum.
.SS \-\-no\-database
.sp
Do not generate sqlite databases in the repository.
.SS \-\-update
.sp
If metadata already exists in the outputdir and an rpm is unchanged (based on file size and mtime) since the metadata was generated, reuse the existing metadata rather than recalculating it. In the case of a large repository with only a few new or modified rpms this can significantly reduce I/O and processing time.
.SS \-\-update\-md\-path
.sp
Use the existing repodata for \-\-update from this path.
.SS \-\-skip\-stat
.sp
Skip the stat() call on a \-\-update, assumes if the filename is the same then the file is still the same (only use this if you\(aqre fairly trusting or gullible).
.SS \-\-split
.sp
Run in split media mode. Rather than pass a single directory, take a set of directories corresponding to different volumes in a media set. Meta data is created in the first given directory
.SS \-i \-\-pkglist FILENAME
.sp
Specify a text file which contains the complete list of files to include in the repository from the set found in the directory. File format is one package per line, no wildcards or globs.
.SS \-n \-\-includepkg PACKAGE
.sp
Specify pkgs to include on the command line. Takes urls as well as local paths.
.SS \-o \-\-outputdir URL
.sp
Optional output directory.
.SS \-S \-\-skip\-symlinks
.sp
Ignore symlinks of packages.
.SS \-\-changelog\-limit NUM
.sp
Only import the last N changelog entries, from each rpm, into the metadata.
.SS \-\-unique\-md\-filenames
.sp
Include the file\(aqs checksum in the metadata filename, helps HTTP caching (default).
.SS \-\-simple\-md\-filenames
.sp
Do not include the file\(aqs checksum in the metadata filename.
.SS \-\-retain\-old\-md NUM
.sp
Keep around the latest (by timestamp) N copies of the old repodata.
.SS \-\-distro DISTRO
.sp
Distro tag and optional cpeid: \-\-distro\(aqcpeid,textname\(aq.
.SS \-\-content CONTENT_TAGS
.sp
Tags for the content in the repository.
.SS \-\-repo REPO_TAGS
.sp
Tags to describe the repository itself.
.SS \-\-revision REVISION
.sp
User\-specified revision for this repository.
.SS \-\-set-timestamp-to-revision
.sp
Set timestamp field in metatada to value given with \-\-revision. This require
\-\-revision being a timestamp formated in "date +%s" format. This option also
clamp created files modification time to the same value.
.SS \-\-read\-pkgs\-list READ_PKGS_LIST
.sp
Output the paths to the pkgs actually read useful with \-\-update.
.SS \-\-workers
.sp
Number of workers to spawn to read rpms.
.SS \-\-xz
.sp
Use xz for repodata compression.
.SS \-\-zck
.sp
Generate zchunk files as well as the standard repodata.
.SS \-\-zck\-primary\-dict ZCK_PRIMARY_DICT
.sp
Compression dictionary to use for zchunk primary file
.SS \-\-zck\-filelists\-dict ZCK_FILELISTS_DICT
.sp
Compression dictionary to use for zchunk filelists file
.SS \-\-zck\-other\-dict ZCK_OTHER_DICT
.sp
Compression dictionary to use for zchunk other file
.SS \-\-compress\-type COMPRESSION_TYPE
.sp
Which compression type to use.
.SS \-\-general\-compress\-type COMPRESSION_TYPE
.sp
Which compression type to use (even for primary, filelists and other xml).
.SS \-\-keep\-all\-metadata
.sp
Keep groupfile and updateinfo from source repo during update.
.SS \-\-compatibility
.sp
Enforce maximal compatibility with classical createrepo.
.SS \-\-retain\-old\-md\-by\-age AGE
.sp
During \-\-update, remove all files in repodata/ which are older then the specified period of time. (e.g. \(aq2h\(aq, \(aq30d\(aq, ...). Available units (m \- minutes, h \- hours, d \- days)
.SS \-c \-\-cachedir CACHEDIR.
.sp
Set path to cache dir
.SS \-\-deltas
.sp
Tells createrepo to generate deltarpms and the delta metadata.
.SS \-\-oldpackagedirs PATH
.sp
Paths to look for older pkgs to delta against. Can be specified multiple times.
.SS \-\-num\-deltas INT
.sp
The number of older versions to make deltas against. Defaults to 1.
.SS \-\-max\-delta\-rpm\-size MAX_DELTA_RPM_SIZE
.sp
Max size of an rpm that to run deltarpm against (in bytes).
.SS \-\-local\-sqlite
.sp
Gen sqlite DBs locally (into a directory for temporary files). Sometimes, sqlite has a trouble to gen DBs on a NFS mount, use this option in such cases. This option could lead to a higher memory consumption if TMPDIR is set to /tmp or not set at all, because then the /tmp is used and /tmp dir is often a ramdisk.
.SS \-\-cut\-dirs NUM
.sp
Ignore NUM of directory components in location_href during repodata generation
.SS \-\-location\-prefix PREFIX
.sp
Append this prefix before location_href in output repodata
.SS \-\-repomd\-checksum CHECKSUM_TYPE
.sp
Checksum type to be used in repomd.xml
.SS \-\-error\-exit\-val
.sp
Exit with retval 2 if there were any errors during processing
.SS \-\-ignore\-lock
.sp
Expert (risky) option: Ignore an existing .repodata/. (Remove the existing .repodata/ and create an empty new one to serve as a lock for other createrepo intances. For the repodata generation, a different temporary dir with the name in format .repodata.time.microseconds.pid/ will be used). NOTE: Use this option on your own risk! If two createrepos run simultaneously, then the state of the generated metadata is not guaranted \- it can be inconsistent and wrong.
